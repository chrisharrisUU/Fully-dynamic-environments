# Abstract / To Do

Journal: Memory & Cognition  
Narrative: Wir untersuchen Zyklizität, Leben ist häufig zyklisch, wurde bisher nicht untersucht sondern immer nur stationär oder mit Trends.  
Für jetzt mit Simulationen rechnen, die nur 10,000 Runs haben. Erst für die Publikation mit 100,000 rechnen.  
Strategien:  
Windows - Kareev  
Recency weighting - LeMens  
Constructivist - Juslin  
Was tun Menschen? Was sollten sie tun?  
Immer das warum? Warum sind manche Strategien gut und andere schlecht?  
Diskussion: Entweder Menschen sind relativ gut im Umgang mit Zyklizität oder unsere theoretische Toolbox an Strategien ist unvollständig.

# Theory
Much about our surrounding environment follows cyclic patterns. As the earth orbits the sun, day and night alternate while seasons come and go. These largescale patterns then dictate patterns in our lives: We tend to structure our awake time around day and night times and we tend to engage in different activities depending on the time of the year. For many, the seasons influence the available foods and for many workers (e.g. farmers) the seasons prescribe the type of work currently to be done. Cyclic patterns are everywhere in life.  

However, the current decision making literature does not seem to represent this supposition adequately. Most paradigms that involve decisions between two or more options have either static outcome probabilities or include but a single change (gradual or abrupt) <citations>. Only few studies include cyclic variations in the outcome probabilities (e.g. Bott & Heit, 2004). This not only limits the external validity of studies but, far more fundamentally, affects the decision strategies to be invested. For example, probability matching becomes a powerful, adaptive strategy once there are patterns to be detected (Gaissmeier, xxx) while at the same time its precise definition in a cyclic environment becomes unclear. And foraging theories need to account for continuous exploration, or at the least flexibility during exploitation phases as maximizing alone will not be an adaptive behavior.  

Here, we create a two-armed bandit task with continuously, sinusoidally interweaving outcome probabilities and simulate three decision making strategies (decision windows, recency weighting, and constructivist coding) as well as two normative strategies (guessing and omniscient). We then have participants complete the bandit task and match these strategies to their behavior. The two normativce strategies serve as benchmarks for behavior.

## Strategies 
Two- or multi-armed bandit tasks have become somewhat of a gold standard in the decision making literature. They allow for a controlled environment in which to analyse participants' behavior and then match their behavior to predictions made by decision strategies.  

(...)  

Three such families of strategies we will investigate closer.

### Windows

Kareev (1995, 1997) argues that small samples hava an advantage in detecting correlation due to the stronger skew of the covariation the smaller the sample is. This proposition was quickly picked up by others. For example, Hertwig and Todd (2005) and Kareev (2000) argue that cognitive limitations are, in fact, adaptive as they allow for quicker learning of contingencies. Furthermore, the cognitive limitations make it implausible that humans can always keep track of the full outcome history in order to determine the next choice. Instead, it is a reasonable assumption that only the last few trials, a recent historic window, are used to determine the next choice (Otto et al., 2011).  

### Recency Weighting

LeMens

### Constructivist Coding

Until now, all strategies assumed that the decision maker receives feedback on every trial and ignores non-feedback trials (such as the option not chosen). Costructivist Coding, however, proposes that in the absense of feedback, decision makers memorize the expected outcome. Future decisions will then be based not only on experienced outcomes but also on constructed outcomes where necessary (Elwin, Juslin, Olsson, & Enkvist, 2007; Ghaffarzadegan & Stewart, 2011; Henriksson, Elwin, & Juslin, 2010). In bandit tasks in which the decision maker only receives feedback for the chosen outcome, an outcome for the alternative option might be constructed for every single trial.  

# Methods 

## Simulations
Part I: Simulation of strategies. Performance. Which strategies perform best. Why?  

## Experiment
Part II: Matching to participant data. What do participants seem to do?

# Results
Which strategies perform best and why, what do people seem to do.

# Discussion
Match or discrepancy of simulation and experiment?
